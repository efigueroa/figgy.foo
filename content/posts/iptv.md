>What is IPTV and why should I use it? 

## What?

IPTV is cable tv over the internet. Channels and PPV events are gathered together and streamed to you via an app for a much better price than paying for 12 different providers. 

## Why? 

With IPTV you pay a fantastically lower total price and get a fantastically greater amount of content for it. Yes, you'll get every UFC fight, every boxing match, and every single NFL game for the following prices. 

## How (much)? 

This method will cost roughly $10 USD a month depending on which plan you sign up with.

Here's what plans cost at time of posting. They're listed in Canadian because that's where the provider you'll be paying is located. Don't worry, right now $91 CND is $65 USD.

| Duration | Price (CAD) | Price (USD) |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 month  | $17         | ~$12         |
| 3 months | $45         | ~$32         |
| 5 months | $70         | ~$50         |
| 7 months | $91         | ~$66         |
| 12 months| $144        | ~$104        |

## About This IPTV Source

This is a Canadian based **independent IPTV service**, and it's just one that I personally use and recommend. It’s not some big-name brand, and it’s not affiliated with any major cable company. Just a solid source I’ve been happy with.

They’re friendly, responsive, and flexible with devices. Works well for me and a few of my family members. No pressure, no upsells, no hidden junk.

# Actually watching  
## Not on a TV:

Best App for Phones, Tablets, and PC: [Open-TV](https://github.com/Fredolx/open-tv)

If you're on:
- iPhone or iPad 📱
- Android phone or tablet 🤖
- Windows or macOS computer 💻

I **highly recommend** using the free app [Open-TV](https://github.com/Fredolx/open-tv). It’s open-source, clean, easy to use, and doesn't have any ads or junk.

Once you get your login details (A url, username, password) just plug them in and you're good to go. Easy stuff.

## TV Setup Options

### 🟢 Easiest Option (for most people)

If you're using a **Fire Stick**, **Nvidia Shield**, or **Android TV box**, the IPTV team offers their own super simple TV app. They’ll give you instructions to install it directly using a code in the **Downloader** app.

This is best if you just want to click and watch — no extra setup, no options to tweak.
