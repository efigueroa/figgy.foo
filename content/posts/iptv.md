> 📡 What is IPTV and why should you bother with it?

## 🤔 What Is IPTV?

**IPTV** is like cable TV — but over the internet. Instead of paying for 10+ services, IPTV gives you access to a huge bundle of live TV channels and pay-per-view events, all in one app, for one low price.

---

## 💸 Why Use IPTV?

Because it's dramatically cheaper and gives you *way* more.

- Every UFC fight
- Every major boxing match
- Every single NFL game  
All included — no extra fees.

---

## 💰 How Much Does It Cost?

Plans are billed in Canadian dollars, but here’s a quick breakdown with USD conversions:

| Duration | Price (CAD) | Price (USD) |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 month  | $17         | ~$12        |
| 3 months | $45         | ~$32        |
| 5 months | $70         | ~$50        |
| 7 months | $91         | ~$66        |
| 12 months| $144        | ~$104       |

*(Exchange rate: 1 CAD ≈ 0.72 USD)*
